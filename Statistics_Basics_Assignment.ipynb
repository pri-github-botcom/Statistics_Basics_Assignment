        "1) Nominal Data: This is the simplest form of qualitative data. Nominal data represents categories with no specific order or ranking. The categories are mutually exclusive.\n",

A distribution is symmetric if it is evenly balanced around its centre, but if one side of the distribution has a longer or fatter tail, it is skewed.
